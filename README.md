The Ames Housing Price Prediction Competition presents a dataset of 79 explanatory variables describing various aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The goal is to use these variables to predict the final price of each home.

Participation in this competition allows for the practice of creative feature engineering and advanced regression techniques such as random forest and gradient boosting. It provides a valuable opportunity to work with real-world data and build accurate and robust predictive models.

The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education and serves as an excellent alternative to the often cited Boston Housing dataset.
